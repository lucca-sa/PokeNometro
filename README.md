# PokeNometro
</br>
I'm thrilled to introduce my PokÃ©mon-themed stopwatch project, a delightful addition to my programming portfolio. Crafted as a learning endeavor, this project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The combination of these technologies allowed me to create
a dynamic and interactive stopwatch with a charming PokÃ©mon twist. Embracing responsive design principles, this stopwatch seamlessly adjusts to various screen sizes and devices. 
Building this project was an absolute blast, as it not only honed my coding skills but also allowed me to infuse my love for programming with a single creative endeavor.
